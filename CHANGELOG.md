## [v1.0.1] - 2025-07-06
### Fixed
* Resolved problems with multiple robot vacuums in a single Matterbridge instance, caused by duplicate Matter.js enum values.

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-07-05
### Added
* Improved Apple Home compatibility for robot vacuum devices by using Matterbridge's `server` mode, which exposes each robot vacuum as a standalone Matter node instead of bridging them. This mode is enabled by default and requires robot vacuum devices to be re-paired with the Matter controller. It can be disabled by setting the `"enableServerRvc": false` configuration option. Requires Matterbridge version 3.1.1 or later.
### Fixed
* Corrected `productUrl` attribute values in the Bridged Device Basic Information cluster.
### Changed
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.2.10] - 2025-06-28

### Changed
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.2.9] - 2025-06-21
### Changed

### Changed
* Minor logging improvements.

## [v0.2.2] - 2025-05-23
### Added
* Support `MACHINE_OFF` robot vacuum state (sometimes reported by the AWS IoT MQTT broker).
* Use `GONE-AWAY` and `GOODBYE` messages as indications that the device is unreachable.
* Accept `HELLO` commands from robot vacuums.
### Fixed
* Reachability is indicated for air treatment machines. Previously it was only set for robot vacuums.
### Changed
* Update of multiple attributes in the same cluster are now sequenced to avoid transaction collisions.

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-05-22
### Fixed
* Avoid unnecessary attribute updates.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-05-22
### Added
* MQTT credentials for each device can be obtained from the associated MyDyson account, minimising the required manual configuration.
* Connections can now be routed via the Dyson AWS IoT gateway. This allows use of devices and firmware versions that do not support local MQTT connections.
### Fixed
* Compatibility with Matterbridge version 3.0.3.
* Fan speed (`SpeedSetting` and `PercentSetting`) is set to `null` in `Auto` mode.
### Changed
* The configuration schema has been revised to support the MyDyson account and AWS IoT features. Previous configurations will need to be updated.
* Updated dependencies.

## [v0.1.1] - 2025-05-16
### Changed
* Improved configuration schema with enum to select `entityWhiteList`/`entityBlackList` values.
