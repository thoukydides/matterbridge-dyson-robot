When assessing issue quality, use the following guidance to determine where users should be directed:

- **🐞 [Bug report](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml)** issue template with `bug` label
  - Bug reports **must** use the Bug Report template; it collects essential diagnostic information (version, logs, device details) required to resolve most issues
  - Close the issue and ask the user to refile if they are clearly reporting a bug but have not used the Bug Report template

- **🚧 [Feature Request](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml)** issue template with `enhancement` label
  - Feature request should use the Feature Request template, but this is less critical than for bug reports
  - If the request is clear, and not combined with other issues, then the issue can be left open even if a different template was used

- **👌 [Compatible Device](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot/issues/new?template=compatible-device.yml)** issue template with `compatible device` label
  - The README.md includes a list of devices that have been tested and confirmed compatible; additions to this list should be reported using the Compatible Device template
  - Accept reports submitted using other templates, even if combined with other issues

- **💬 [Discussions](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot/discussions)**
  - Discussions are preferred for general questions/support or for early-stage feature ideas ("How do I...?", "Why does...?", "Can you explain...?")
  - Can leave the issue open with gentle guidance to use Discussions next time

- **🤖 [Ask Dosu](https://github.dosu.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot)**
  - The Dosu AI assistant has been trained on this project's source code, Wiki, and previous issues (plus other relevant background knowledge)
  - For any support issues that are unlikely to require changes to the project implementation suggest that asking Dosu could result in a quicker answer (requires a free https://dosu.dev/ account)
