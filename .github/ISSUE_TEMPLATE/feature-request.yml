        Before creating a new feature request, please search [closed/rejected issues](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-dyson-robot/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to avoid duplicates.

        🚨 Feature requests that propose any of the following are unlikely to be accepted:
        - Implementing Matter clusters not supported by Apple Home
        - Using Matter clusters in ways that violate CSA specifications
        - Disabling or suppressing existing functionality via additional configuration options

        Describe the feature or improvement you would like to see. 
        Be specific: What problem does it solve? How would a user experience it differently?

        What should the plugin do?
        Why is this needed?
        How would a user interact with it in Apple Home or other Matter ecosystems?

        If this enhancement relates to a specific appliance, please provide the model name and number. These details can be found behind the clear bin on robot vacuums, or on the base of air treatment devices.

      description: |
        Describe how this feature is supported by the Dyson MQTT protocol. Include:
        - A brief explanation of the observed MQTT behaviour
        - A relevant MQTT message log extract (see below)
        - Or link to another open source project that supports this feature

        Use either of these methods to capture an MQTT message log:
        
        1. Matterbridge plugin log:
        
          - In the Matterbridge frontend: *Home* > *Plugins* > *matterbridge-dyson-robot* > ⚙️
            - *debug* > ✅
            - *Enable advanced debug option* > *Log MQTT Payloads as JSON*
          - Or in `matterbridge-dyson-robot.config.json`:
            ```json
            "debug": true,
            "debugFeatures": ["Log MQTT Payloads as JSON"]
            ```
          - View logs with: `journalctl -u matterbridge.service -n 1000 -f --output cat`
        
        2. Using the `opendyson` tool:

          - Install `opendyson`, e.g. if `Go` is installed and configured:
            `go install github.com/libdyson-wg/opendyson`
          - Login to your MyDyson account:
            `opendyson login`
          - Identify devices and retrieve their connection credentials:
            `opendyson devices`
          - Capture an MQTT message log:
            `opendyson listen SERIALNUMBER` (with the device's actual serial number substituted)
        
        Paste the log below or attached as a text file. Do NOT use a screenshot. Replace sensitive information (access tokens, etc) with `REDACTED`.

        Suggest which Matter cluster(s) from the [Matter Application Cluster Specification](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/specifications-download-request/) might apply.

        Note: Apple Home only supports a subset of Matter clusters. The most accurate (though somewhat out-of-date) information is available in [this Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102135) and [the Matter.js overview of the Matter ecosystems](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/blob/main/docs/ECOSYSTEMS.md).

        If the requested feature maps to a Matter cluster that is unsupported by Apple Home it is unlikely to be implemented, even if technically valid within Matter.

        **Important notes:**
        📄 Feature requests must be compatible with both the Matter specification and the Dyson API.
        🚫 Requests that fall outside the scope of either, or that are unsupported by Apple Home, are unlikely to be implemented.
        🧪 This is a personal project focused on my own usage. Suggestions are welcome, but may be declined without further discussion.
        💡 Well-reasoned, clearly scoped ideas with relevant technical context, are more likely to be considered.
